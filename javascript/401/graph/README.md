# Graphs:

he graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

add vertex
Arguments: value
Returns: The added vertex
Add a vertex to the graph
add edge
Arguments: 2 vertices to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
Returns: nothing
Adds a new edge between two vertices in the graph
If specified, assign a weight to the edge
Both vertices should already be in the Graph
get vertices
Arguments: none
Returns all of the vertices in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
Empty collection returned if there are no vertices
get neighbors
Arguments: vertex
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given vertex
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
Empty collection returned if there are no vertices
size
Arguments: none
Returns the total number of vertices in the graph
0 if there are none
