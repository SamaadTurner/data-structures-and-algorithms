# Challenge: Hash map left join

# Problem Domain:

Create a function named "leftJoin" that takes two hash maps as arguments. The first hash map should have word strings as keys, each mapped to its synonym. The second hash map should also have word strings as keys, each mapped to its antonym. The function should perform a left join operation between these two hash maps and return a new data structure to hold the results. The specific format of the returned data structure is flexible, as long as it implements the LEFT JOIN logic.

# Approach and Efficiency:

Time: O(n*m)
Space: O(n)
