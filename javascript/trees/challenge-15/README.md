# Binary Tree and BST Implementation
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in computer science composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. A binary search tree (BST) is a specific type of binary tree in which the nodes are organized such that for each node, all values in its left subtree are less than or equal to its value, and all values in its right subtree are greater than its value. This arrangement allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, making it a valuable data structure for various applications, such as searching and sorting algorithms.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Wanted to do this in o(n) and that what I wad hoping for.

## Solution
To run code node index.js (when in the correct directory).
