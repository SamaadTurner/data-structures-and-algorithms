# Stacks and Queues  

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

ex:
Think of a stack like a stack of plates. You can only add or remove plates from the top of the stack.

## Common operations on stack: 
Push: Adding an element to the top of the stack in O(1) usually.
Pop: Removing the top element from the stack.
Peek: Viewing the top element without removing it.

A queue is another linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

## Ex: 

- Think of a queue like a line of people waiting for a service. The person who arrives first is  served first.
- Queues are used in situations where tasks need to be processed in the order they were received, such as print job scheduling, task management in operating systems, or web request handling in web servers. 


## Common operations on a queue:

Enqueue: Adding an element to the back of the queue.
Dequeue: Removing the front element from the queue.

# Summary:

A stack is a data structure that operates on the principle of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO), while a queue operates on the principle of First-In-First-Out (FIFO). They have different use cases and are employed in various algorithms and applications to manage data efficiently based on their respective behaviors.
